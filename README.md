This project focuses on the performance evaluation of a service system with concurrent jobs using Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPN). It analyzes two scenarios: random queue selection and priority-based queue selection, comparing key performance metrics such as throughput, loss rates, and server utilization. Simulations were conducted using the PN Toolbox in Matlab. The study demonstrates the utility of Petri nets for modeling and analyzing complex systems with varying service and arrival rates.
